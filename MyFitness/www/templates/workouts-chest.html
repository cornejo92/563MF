          Barbell Bench Press
        </div>
        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
          Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
          From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.
          After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
          Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
          <br>
          When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
          Position two equally loaded EZ bars on the ground next to each other. Ensure they are able to roll.
Assume a push-up position over the bars, supporting your weight on your toes and hands with your arms extended and body straight.
Place your hands on the bars. This will be your starting position.
Using a slow and controlled motion, move your hands away from the midline of your body, rolling the bars apart. Inhale during this portion of the motion.
After moving the bars as far apart as you can, return to the starting position by pulling them back together. Exhale as you perform this movement.

          Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.
Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.
Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.
Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
          To get yourself into the starting position, place the pulleys on a high position (above your head), select the resistance to be used and hold the pulleys in each hand.
Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position.
With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

          Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand.
Stand directly between both pulleys with your arms extended out to your sides. Your head and chest should be up while your arms form a “T”. This will be your starting position.
Keeping the elbows extended, pull your arms straight to your sides.
Return your arms back to the starting position after a pause at the peak contraction.
Continue the movement for the prescribed number of repetitions.
